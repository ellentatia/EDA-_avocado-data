# EDA-_avocado-data
Kaggle data aquired from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018.

The following information taken from the Board website about the data is important for understanding its content and context.

> The table below represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

Some relevant columns in the dataset:

Date - The date of the observation
AveragePrice - the average price of a single avocado
type - conventional or organic
year - the year
Region - the city or region of the observation
Total Volume - Total number of avocados sold
4046 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold
4225 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold
4770 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold

Kaggle brings two inspiration questions to base our analysis on. I will take them in consideration but will also make my own questions.

Kaggle Inspirations:
1.In which cities can millenials have their avocado toast AND buy a home?
2.Was the Avocadopocalypse of 2017 real?
